The material I present here is a collection of tips from supervisors, colleagues, online resources, and the extracts from the course [Academic Publication and Presentation in the Social Sciences](https://www.wur.nl/en/activity/academic-publication-and-presentation-in-the-social-sciences-4-ects.htm) course organized by Wageningen School of Social Sciences ([WASS](https://www.wur.nl/en/show/wageningen-school-of-social-sciences-wass.htm)). It is everything I would have wanted to know at the start of my PhD journey.

# Basic principles

## General issues

*Language* - Obviously, write in English for a broader audience. In many cases, you can request to the journal the permission to publish in another language somewhere else.

*Authorship* - Try to publish a single author paper ASAP.

*Edited volumes and chapters* - Often you receive an invitation. Very expensive, not a lot of viewership (ppl have to buy the entire book). You can first publish the same material. Often they take a long time to produce. 

## Practical tips 

-	Study what interests you. You will not work hard enough, or smart enough, otherwise. 
-	Talk to people about research all of the time. Do not be shy or humble. Attend seminars and conferences. 
-	Be persistent and do not get discouraged. Expect and accept rejection. 
-	Perfection is a standard that can never be achieved. 
-	The research process is non-linear. Be prepared to go back to earlier stages of the research process and refine your questions, approach, etc.

Research ≠ Analysis. Research is telling a “story” – to other scholars, policymakers, students, etc. Analysis is an important, but small part, of research. Most young researchers forget this last point.

# Title page

It can be helpful to write the title and abstract before you start your paper, and then rewrite them later.

## Title 

## Abstract

## Keywords

They are needed to improve visibility of your research. Try not to repeat title words.

## JEL codes

The JEL classification system was developed for use in the Journal of Economic Literature (JEL), and is a standard method of classifying scholarly literature in the field of economics.

# Introduction

The introduction is the most important section of a written paper. It should be edited/rewritten many, many times. It should be written first and rewritten/updated every time you write other sections. The following formula is a great place to start but then ask yourself, what does this formula miss for my paper? What do I need to add? What do I need to subtract? Will reorganizing any key points help me tell the economic “story” more clearly?

- *Paragraph 1* - Why is the general subject interesting and important? Why might someone not in your discipline think this is important? 
- *Paragraph 2* - What is the specific question and what does this paper do? You should actually write, “This paper address the question of ….” or “This paper explores…” 
- *Paragraph 3* - The contribution or value-added. Describe approximately 3 contributions of the paper relative to the studies that have gone before it. What is new and novel, and why is this new material important for knowledge. 
- *Paragraph 4* - What exactly does the paper do? Summarize key research strategies (and key data). If a reader would anticipate an obvious problem with your approach (i.e. endogeneity), signal how you address the problem.
- *Paragraph 5* - Results. What do you find? If possible, restate how the findings are novel and important, perhaps signaling but not necessarily detailing implications for policy or the real world. 
- *Paragraph 6* - The roadmap. Outline the organization of the remainder of the paper. Be specific enough, though, to avoid an outline that could go in any paper.

## Good research questions

What makes a good research question? 
-	The question is important if X changes: Many people are worse off or better off. Important subpopulations are far better off or far worse off. 
-	The question is controversial or puzzling. Test of an important theoretical prediction. 
-	The subject is very common or involves large outlays of social resources. 

A good question will often complete the following statements: “I wonder if ….” ; “It is interesting that …”. If you can’t convince yourself that your research question falls into one of these categories, you may need a new question.

## Research gaps

Don’t stress the “gap” but instead frame what you are doing in terms of “contribution”, “new perspective”, or generally add to the literature. Otherwise it can be attacked.

## What to put here?

- Theoretical Framework
- Empirical Framework
- Data and Descriptive Statistics
- Results and Discussion

### Tips:
- No separate “literature review” section. Your literature review should be a one-paragraph affair in your introduction explaining how your work relates to the closest five to seven studies on the topic.
- You might want to have a section titled “Background” between the introduction and the theoretical framework. This is especially so when you study a legislative change, a new policy whose details are important or, in an IO paper, the features of the market you are studying. This can either be a substitute for or a complement to the theoretical framework.
- You might not need a theoretical framework. Some questions are old and the theory behind them is well documented and does not need to be restated.
- The order between the “Empirical Framework” and “Data and Descriptive Statistics” sections can sometimes be switched. Go with what is logical here.
- Limitations should be emphasized. This is especially true if your work has any policy relevance; you don’t want anyone to interpret your results in ways they should not be interpreted.

## Visualizations 

Every part of your paper should quickly support the story. Read [Schwabish, 2014](https://www-aeaweb-org.ezproxy.library.wur.nl/articles?id=10.1257/jep.28.1.209)

*A good picture can be worth much more than a thousand words*<br>

Data visualization principles: 
-	show the data to tell the economic story
-	Use simple and consistent design elements 
-	Avoid clutter and unnecessary complexity (focus on key points, the story)
-	Integrate text with graphs to transfer information quickly
Best practices: 
-	Using clear and concise labels
-	Avoiding 3D effects and unnecessary animation
-	Providing context and scale information
-	Using interactive visualizations when appropriate

# Conclusions

[The Conclusion Formula](https://marcfbellemare.com/wordpress/12060) - Marc F. Bellemare

Good conclusions vary a lot. 
-	Brief summary 
-	Interpretation exercises (put results in context) 
-	Limitations and directions for future research 
-	Implications for economics and policy

Once you wrote your article you need to publish it. You probably want to know how [the publication process at economics field journal](publication_process.html) works.
