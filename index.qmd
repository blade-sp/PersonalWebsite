# About Me

I'm currently based in The Netherlands where I'm pursuing my PhD in Agricultural Economics with the [Business Economic](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/social-sciences/business-economics-group.htm) group at [Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl/en). 

[My research](research.html) focuses on risk management, behavioral economics, and resilience in agri-food systems.
