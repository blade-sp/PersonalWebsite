# About Me

I'm currently based in The Netherlands where I'm pursuing my PhD in Agricultural Economics at the [Business Economic](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/social-sciences/business-economics-group.htm) group. 

My research focuses on risk management, behavioral economics, and resilience in agri-food systems. 

I'm also passionate about personal finance and financial decision-making.
