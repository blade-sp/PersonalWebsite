Your literature review should be a one-paragraph affair in your introduction explaining how your work relates to the closest five to seven studies on the topic.\nYou might want to have a section titled “Background” between the introduction and the theoretical framework. This is especially so when you study a legislative change, a new policy whose details are important or, in an IO paper, the features of the market you are studying. This can either be a substitute for or a complement to the theoretical framework.\nYou might not need a theoretical framework. Some questions are old and the theory behind them is well documented and does not need to be restated.\nThe order between the “Empirical Framework” and “Data and Descriptive Statistics” sections can sometimes be switched. Go with what is logical here.\nLimitations should be emphasized. This is especially true if your work has any policy relevance; you don’t want anyone to interpret your results in ways they should not be interpreted."
